The future of communications is now. Traditional email has problems ranging from reliability to just too much spam.
LiteNote (RSL), a cryptocurrency with support for built in email-like messaging, solves all these problems.

Using our new model, spam can be stopped just by ignoring it. Sending a message costs a small amount of LiteNote,
and you get LiteNote whenever you receive a message. If you do not reply to spammers, they will eventually run out
of LiteNote and be unable to send more spam.
